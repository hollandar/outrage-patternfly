# Outrage Patternfly

Outrage Patternfly is a collection of components for [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) that make use of the [Patternfly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/).

## Why?

Bootstrap is great, but so is Patternfly, and especially so for building apps on blazor.

It looks great (your are looking at it right now).  And it namespaces its css classes really well, so your styles wont collide with it.

## Why Outrage Patternfly?

We are building our own apps for us, and for our customers.  We found that we spent a lot of time fighting with other control libraries:

* They are not just blazor
* They arent well namespaced
* And, they still need extra styling

So, Outrage Patternfly is:

* Just components for Patternfly
* Built only as Blazor components
* Has no Javascript dependencies

## Want more

Because Patternfly is modified using CSS variables, so it Outrage Patternfly

## Licensing

Outrage Patternfly is open source, and free for use in open source projects.

You may not release the software or a modified version of it (free or otherwise). 

If you find it useful in your business, you must purchase a low cost commercial license; this covers some of our support costs and helps us grow the library.
