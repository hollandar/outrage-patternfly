# Outrage Patternfly

Outrage Patternfly is a collection of components for [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) that make use of the [Patternfly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/).

## Why?

Bootstrap is great, but so is Patternfly, and especially so for building apps on blazor.

It looks great (your are looking at it right now).  And it namespaces its css classes really well, so your styles wont collide with it.

## Why Outrage Patternfly?

We are building our own apps for us, and for our customers.  We found that we spent a lot of time fighting with other control libraries:

* They are not just blazor
* They arent well namespaced
* And, they still need extra styling

So, Outrage Patternfly is:

* Just components for Patternfly
* Built only as Blazor components
* Has no Javascript dependencies

## Want more

Because Patternfly is modified using CSS variables, so it Outrage Patternfly


## Standard attributes

Unless mentioned otherwise, all patternfly elements support the following:

* *Class* : Custom css classes to be passed.
* Additional attributes : Attributes that do not map to parameters on the patternfly object are passed as html attributes into the underlying HTML.

## Licensing

Outrage Patternfly is open source, and free for use in open source and not-for-profit projects.

Outrage Patternfly (the Blazor components) are Copyright (C) Webefinity Pty. Ltd. 2022.

If you find it useful in your business, you must purchase a low cost commercial license; this covers some of our support costs and helps us grow the library.

## Patternfly itself

You may, but need not, make use of the embedded version of the patternfly library.  You can also use these components using patternfly included via your own custom build process.
